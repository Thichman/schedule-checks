## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. **Google Chrome** browser installed.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the program files):
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd website-check-program
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv website_monitor_env
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source website_monitor_env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     website_monitor_env\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The following packages will be installed:
   - `selenium`: To interact with web pages and take screenshots.
   - `webdriver-manager`: Automatically manages the appropriate ChromeDriver for your browser.
   - `Pillow`: For image comparison between screenshots.
   - `schedule`: For scheduling periodic checks of websites.

## How to Run the Program

Once you've completed the setup, you can start the program:

1. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. You will see a command prompt where you can start interacting with the program. For example:
   ```bash
   > help
   ```

The program will start monitoring websites that you add, but you can also run commands in real-time while the program is running.

You can also start the program by providing an initial URL to monitor:
   ```bash
   python main.py https://example.com
   ```

## Available Commands

The following commands can be used to interact with the program:

1. **`add-url <URL>`**  
   Adds a URL to the list of active URLs being monitored.
   ```bash
   > add-url https://example.com
   ```

2. **`list-urls`**  
   Lists all active URLs currently being monitored.
   ```bash
   > list-urls
   ```

3. **`run-check`**  
   Manually run a check for changes on all active URLs.
   ```bash
   > run-check
   ```

4. **`open-url <URL>`**  
   Opens the specified URL in your default browser.
   ```bash
   > open-url https://example.com
   ```

5. **`open-readme`**  
   Opens this README file in your default browser for reference.
   ```bash
   > open-readme
   ```

6. **`help`**  
   Displays a list of all available commands and their descriptions.
   ```bash
   > help
   ```

## Examples

1. **Add a URL to Monitor**:
   ```bash
   > add-url https://example.com
   ```

2. **List All Active URLs**:
   ```bash
   > list-urls
   ```

3. **Manually Run a Check**:
   ```bash
   > run-check
   ```

4. **Open a URL in Browser**:
   ```bash
   > open-url https://example.com

## Packaging and Distribution

### Packaging the Project for Sharing

If you want to share this project with someone else, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `requirements.txt` file**:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Zip the project folder**:
   After ensuring all the necessary files (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`) are in the project directory, zip the project:
   ```bash
   zip -r website-monitor.zip .
   ```

3. **Send the zip file** to the recipient. They can unzip it and follow the instructions in this README to set up and run the program.

### Option: Create a Standalone Executable with PyInstaller

To make it even easier for someone to run the program without needing Python installed, you can create a standalone executable using **PyInstaller**.

#### Steps to create an executable:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create the executable**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile main.py
   ```

   This will generate a `dist/` folder containing a single executable file. You can send this file to others, and they can run it without needing Python or any dependencies installed.

## How the Program Works

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - After running the program, you can begin adding URLs via the `add-url` command.
   - URLs are stored in memory (not persistently), so URLs need to be added again if the program is restarted.

2. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - Once youâ€™ve added URLs, the program will automatically check for changes every hour.
   - Screenshots are stored in the same directory as the program.
   - When changes are detected, the program notifies you via the command-line interface.

3. **Manual URL Checking**:
   - You can also run a manual check at any time using the `run-check` command to immediately compare the current version of the page to the last saved screenshot.

4. **Opening URLs**:
   - The `open-url` command opens any monitored URL in your default web browser.

---

## Notes

- **Service Workers Warning**: When viewing screenshots, you may encounter a message about "Service Workers." This warning is harmless and related to the webpage's background scripts, which are irrelevant to static screenshots.
  
- **Screenshot Naming**: Screenshots are saved with filenames based on the URL (non-URL-friendly characters are replaced with underscores).
